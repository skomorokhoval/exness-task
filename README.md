# exness-task run instructions

to run this script you need to pass source path, destination path as params:
- python src/main.py /Users/username/Desktop/source /Users/username/Desktop/destination

Filesystem type can be passed optionally, it is OS by default. If you need to run this script for cloud based filesystem, pass Cloud value.

I have created source and destination folders in project repo as example, but 
it is possible to provide path from any OS location.

Please note, Unit test coverage is not full
